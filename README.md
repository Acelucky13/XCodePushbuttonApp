## App Brainstorming 

My three favorite apps I use daily are:
Facebook messenger - you can facetime with anyone, and messege anyone via messege and calls even to mexico, and other countries where permited.
WhatsAPP - you can call, and facetime, and text anyone in practically any country and takes away the need for a pre-paid cellular card that charges by the minute.
Instagram - for the videos, chat via DM(direct messeges), and video-chat and you can post about just anything including travel, and life in general Vlogs.

# App idea 
An app id love to build would ential a storybook app, it would have the ability for anyone to post their own Children's bed-time short stories -
to share, and sell, and illustrations, for a nominal fee for others to be able to read to their children, and conribute too, the app to buy would be 99$ cents, -
a way back to give to others with low-income to buy books weekly, monthly or daily for their children to enjoy for bed-time or in general reading.
